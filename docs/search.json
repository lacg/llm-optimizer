    "text": "LLM Optimizer is a lightweight, open‑source toolkit that helps developers and researchers tune large language models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks.\nIt provides:\n\n🛠️ Utilities for prompt engineering, hyper‑parameter sweeps, and model‑selection pipelines.\n\n📊 Visualization dashboards (built with Plotly/Dash) to inspect performance across runs.\n\n🤝 Extensible API – you can plug in your own evaluation metrics, data loaders, or model wrappers.\n\n\nTL;DR: “Run fewer experiments, get better results.”\n\n\n\n\nThe rapid proliferation of LLMs has made it easy to train or fine‑tune, but hard to know which fine‑tuning strategy actually works for a given problem.\nLLM Optimizer fills that gap by:\n\nStandardising the experimental workflow.\n\nAutomating the tedious parts (e.g., logging, checkpoint management).\n\nSharing reproducible pipelines so the community can build on each other’s work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n0.3.0 (alpha) – still under heavy development\n\n\nLicense\nCC BY‑4.0 NC (non‑commercial) – see LICENSE in the repo\n\n\nContributions\nWelcome!
