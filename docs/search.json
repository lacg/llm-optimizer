    "text": "Introduction\nThe LLM Optimizer will start small. The main idea is to leverage my previous knowledge using Weightless Neural Networks (WNN (Wilkie and Storie 1995)), Simulated Annealing (SA (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, and Vecchi 1983)), Tabu Search (TS (Glover 1989)) and Genetic Algorithm (GA (Holland 1975)) for optimization tasks and apply to a modern problem, Large Language Models (LLM (Vaswani et al. 2017)).\nThat’s how a meta-heuristic prompt optimization came to be. Use NN/SA/TS/GA to discover high‑quality prompts for a target task. A tiny RAM‑net (a weightless neural network) is trained as a surrogate that quickly predicts how good a prompt will be, so the meta‑heuristic can explore millions of candidates without calling the LLM each time.\n\n\nTimeline (example)\n\n\n\nWeek\nMilestone\n\n\n\n\n0\nBlog launch, research plan\n\n\n1‑2\nData collection set‑up\n\n\n3‑4\nFirst analyses\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nData repository: link later\nCode repo: link later\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nGlover, F. 1989. “Tabu Search – Part i.” ORSA Journal on Computing 1 (3): 190–206. https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.1.1.1.\n\n\nHolland, John H. 1975.
