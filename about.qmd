# What is LLM Optimizer?

LLM Optimizer is a lightweight, **open‑source toolkit** that helps developers and researchers tune large language models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks.  
It provides:

* 🛠️ **Utilities** for prompt engineering, hyper‑parameter sweeps, and model‑selection pipelines.  
* 📊 **Visualization** dashboards (built with Plotly/Dash) to inspect performance across runs.  
* 🤝 **Extensible API** – you can plug in your own evaluation metrics, data loaders, or model wrappers.

> **TL;DR:**  “Run fewer experiments, get better results.”

## Why was it created?

The rapid proliferation of LLMs has made it easy to **train** or **fine‑tune**, but **hard** to know *which* fine‑tuning strategy actually works for a given problem.  
LLM Optimizer fills that gap by:

1. **Standardising** the experimental workflow.  
2. **Automating** the tedious parts (e.g., logging, checkpoint management).  
3. **Sharing** reproducible pipelines so the community can build on each other’s work.
